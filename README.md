# ⛩️ About Me :
My name is Filipe, I'm Brazilian 🇧🇷  and I've dedicated over 15 years of my life as a professional esports athlete. 
My relentless pursuit of excellence extends beyond the gaming world, as I'm driven to continually refine both my professional and personal selves.
With a deep admiration for Japanese values and culture, I strive to embody their commitment to discipline and innovation.
My daily mission is to evolve into a distinguished front-end professional, and I channel my passion into mastering JavaScript and React.<br>
